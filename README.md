# HIV Immunological Evaluation

This repository contains the scripts and datasets used in the study:

**“Immune signatures in HIV infection: IL-6 and viral load predict advanced immunodeficiency, while antiretroviral therapy rapidly reduces sIL-2R levels.”**

The purpose of this repository is to ensure **transparency, reproducibility, and reuse** of the analyses performed in the manuscript.

## 📌 Study overview

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by chronic immune activation and systemic inflammation, which contribute to progressive immunodeficiency and non-AIDS–related comorbidities.  
This study combines **cross-sectional** and **longitudinal** analyses to investigate soluble immune mediators and classical immunological markers in people living with HIV (PLWH).

The analyses include:
- Immune stratification by CD4⁺ T-cell count
- Exploratory multivariate analyses (PCA and K-means clustering)
- Multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of advanced immunodeficiency
- Longitudinal paired analyses evaluating early immune modulation after antiretroviral therapy (ART)

All patients included in the longitudinal analysis received a **dolutegravir-based ART regimen (tenofovir + lamivudine + dolutegravir)**.
